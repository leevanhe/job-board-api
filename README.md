## Job board

The "job-board" project is a test project I created to demonstrate my skills in Laravel. The goal of this project is to build a job board platform where users can view vacancies and companies can post vacancies. This gives me the opportunity to apply various aspects of Laravel, such as setting up an API, managing data in a database, and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Although the project is still in development, I am already structuring the code and building the basic functionalities. However, tests still need to be written to ensure the robustness and reliability of the system. An important part of the project is the choice of authentication. Instead of Laravel Sanctum, which is mainly suitable for simple token-based authentication, I opted to use Laravel Passport. Passport offers expanded functionality, such as support for oAuth2, and is better suited for projects that require a more advanced form of API authentication.

With this project I want to demonstrate that I am able to implement complex functionalities within a Laravel framework and that I am able to put into practice my knowledge of best practices, such as writing tests and using secure authentication protocols. to bring.
